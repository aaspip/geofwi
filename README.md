# GeoFWI

## Description

**GeoFWI** is a lightweight velocity model dataset for deep-learning-based FWI benchmarking. This project is inspired by the OpenFWI project (https://sites.google.com/site/youzuolin044/openfwi) but includes more realistic geological models (e.g., folding layers, faults, and salt bodies). 

Currently, we call it lightweight because this is the first step toward an eventually "heavyweight," very realistic, highly generalizable 3D velocity model dataset for unprecedented high-efficacy deep-learning-empowered FWI studies.

## Examples

Here is a sneak peek of some of the structures and initial results of the GeoFWI project.

Figure below shows a few good/bad predictions using the data-driven DL-based method (SeisInvNet) detailed in Li et al., 2020, Deep learning Inversion of Seismic Data, IEEE TGRS.
