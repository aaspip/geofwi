# GeoFWI

## Description

**GeoFWI** is a lightweight velocity model dataset for deep-learning-based FWI benchmarking. This project is inspired by the OpenFWI project (https://sites.google.com/site/youzuolin044/openfwi) but includes more realistic geological models (e.g., folding layers, faults, and salt bodies). 

Currently, we call it lightweight because this is the first step toward an eventually "heavyweight," very realistic, highly generalizable 3D velocity model dataset for unprecedented high-efficacy deep-learning-empowered FWI studies.

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the geofwi project can be found at
    https://github.com/aaspip/gallery/tree/main/geofwi
All figures in the gallery directory can be reproduced by their corresponding DEMO scripts in the "demo" directory. These gallery figures are also presented below. 

# Below is an example for quickly visualizing a few samples from GeoFWI.npy in different scenarios 
Generated by [demos/test_quick_visualize.py](https://github.com/aaspip/geofwi/tree/main/demos/test_quick_visualize.py)

First scenario: randomly chosen 25 samples from the whole GeoFWI dataset

Second scenario: the first 25 samples from the whole GeoFWI dataset
<img src='https://github.com/aaspip/gallery/blob/main/geofwi/geofwi-samples-increasing.png' alt='comp' width=960/>

Third scenario: the last 25 samples from the whole GeoFWI dataset

Fourth scenario: the last 25 samples in the "11-layer fault category" (e.g., sizes=np.load('data/geofwi-size-layer-fault-salt-1-10.npy'); index is chosen from 49476-sizes[-1]-1 to sizes[-1]-25) from the whole GeoFWI dataset
